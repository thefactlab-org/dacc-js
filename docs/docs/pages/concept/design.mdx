## Overview
![imag](/design.png)

Understanding the core design and workflow of Dacc-js helps you use it effectively and securely.

Dacc-js implements a **Decentralized and still private** approach to wallet management. The key insight is that you can store encrypted data on public blockchains or private storage while maintaining complete privacy, since only you have the decryption key.

## Design Principles

### Ownership
You have complete control over your keys without having to trust any third parties or servers. Dacc-js will never have access to your unencrypted private keys.
### Privacy
No need to handle private keys directly, your private information remains private through encryption.

### Simplicity
Complex cryptography is hidden behind simple function calls.

### Flexibility
Choose between private local storage, DB database, blockchain storage, or other.

### Security
Uses proven cryptographic standards and best practices.
