# Solve problem [The primary goal is to resolve fundamental]

## Overview
![img](/solve.png)

This diagram illustrates the **Core Philosophy** driving the design of the **`dacc-js`** library. The primary goal is to resolve fundamental issues often found in traditional Web3​ wallets for **Web2 solutions** and services: **reliance on intermediaries** and **data centralization**.

## Solved model

`dacc-js` is engineered to eliminate the limitations and security concerns arising from dependency on external services when accessing your account directly.

| Type | The Old Problem | The Dacc-js (Solution) |

| Key | <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>❌ Private Key</span> | <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>✅ Encrypt Public key</span> (daccPublickey)|
| Service | <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>❌ API Dependent</span> | <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>✅ No API Dependency</span> |
| Data | <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>❌ Centralized</span> | <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>✅ Decentralized</span> |

## Key

### <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Problem:</span> Private Key
Traditional wallets require users to directly handle raw private keys, creating significant security and usability challenges:
- **Complex Format:** Managing long hexadecimal strings (64 characters) is error-prone and intimidating for users.
- **Storage Risk:** Private keys stored in plain text files or screenshots are vulnerable to theft or accidental exposure.
- **Recovery Difficulty:** Lost private keys mean permanent loss of assets with no recovery mechanism.
- **Human Error:** Easy to copy incorrectly, share accidentally, or store insecurely.

### <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Solution:</span> Dacc-js - Encrypt Public key (daccPublickey)
`dacc-js` transforms wallet security by using encrypted public keys instead of exposing private keys, while enabling password-based recovery:

- **Familiar Interface:** Users work with passwords they already understand and trust for key recovery.
- **Strong Encryption:** Private keys are never exposed - only encrypted public keys are handled.
- **Password Recovery:** Private keys can be recovered using your password without storing the actual private key.
- **Better UX:** No need to manage complex hexadecimal strings or worry about private key exposure.

> **Enhanced Security:** Your private key can be recovered from your password and encrypted public key, but the private key itself is never stored or transmitted. Even `dacc-js` cannot access your private keys without your password.

## Service

### <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Problem:</span> API Dependent
Most wallet services often rely on a specific provider's API for sending commands, checking status, or even partial key management:
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If the API goes down, the service is interrupted.
- **Censorship Risk:** The service provider can potentially block or restrict your access.

### <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Solution:</span> Dacc-js - No API Dependency
`dacc-js` is built to integrate directly with robust, standard Web3 libraries like **`ethers`** and **`viem`**, as well as other developer tools.

> **By utilizing:** these libraries all transactions are handled **Peer-to-Peer** or by directly connecting to a blockchain node. This means you are **permissionless** and do not require authorization from any intermediary to use your wallet.

## Data

### <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Problem:</span> Centralized
In a centralized system, critical data like Private Keys might be stored on a company's servers (even if claimed to be encrypted). This introduces risks:
- **Data Breach:** If the server is compromised, stored Private Keys are at risk of leakage.
- **Lack of Control:** You do not have absolute, sovereign control over your keys.

### <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Solution:</span> Dacc-js - Decentralized
`dacc-js` adheres strictly to decentralized principles:

- **No Key Storage:** The system **does not store** your unencrypted private keys on any server.
- **Export Capability:** Users can **export their wallet** and independently manage of their encrypted data.

> **The Result:** `dacc-js` returns control of the wallet to the user, ensuring that **your Private Key is your sole asset** and never falls under the control of a third party.
